brownian-motion
===============

A simulation of three dimensional Brownian Motion using a simple hard-sphere model in VPython.

A large, stationary mass is suspended in a randomly arranged lattice of smaller particles which collide with each other and the larger mass. Interactions between objects are modeled as simple hard-sphere (i.e. billiard-ball) collisions; by running this simulation a number of times and measuring the distance that the mass moves each time. If this simulation is accurate to observed brownian motion, these distances will be normally distributed.
